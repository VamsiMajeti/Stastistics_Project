# Bonus Statistics Analysis – Real World Excel Project

## About the Project

This project uses real-world bonus data to perform detailed statistical analysis in Excel. It demonstrates key statistical concepts like mean, median, standard deviation, percentiles, quartiles, Z-scores, outliers, and correlation — all with practical application for a data analyst role.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel.
- Excel Formulas: `AVERAGE()`, `MEDIAN()`, `MODE.SNGL()`, `STDEV.P()`, `STDEV.S()`, `VAR.P()`, `VAR.S()`, `PERCENTILE.INC()`, `Z-score`, etc.
- Charts & Filters.

## File Included

- `Raw_Bonus_Data.xlsx` – Original dataset. (Contains both the questions and answers in it).

## Key Metrics Analyzed

- **Average, Median, Mode, Range**
- **Standard Deviation (P & S), Variance**
- **Quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3), IQR**
- **Outlier Detection using bounds**
- **Percentiles and Percentile Rank**
- **Z-scores for each employee**
- **Real-world insights from data**

## Insights

- Identified outliers in bonus distribution.
- Found Simran to have the lowest Z-score and Riya closest to average.
- Used IQR method to detect upper and lower bounds.
- Calculated 80th percentile to define performance benchmarks.

## Lessons Learned

- Z-scores and IQR help deeply understand data spread.
- Visualizing statistics helps explain it better to others.
- Excel is powerful for real-world data analysis when used creatively.

## How to Use

1. Open `Statistics_Analysis.xlsx`.
2. Explore the calculated cells and charts.
